The output of a conventional Littrow ECDL is reflected from a plane mirror fixed parallel to the tuning diffraction grating. Using a free-space Michelson wavemeter to measure the laser wavelength, we can tune the laser over a range greater than 10 nm without any alteration of alignment.},

  abstract = {Operating a laser diode in an extended cavity which provides frequency-selective feedback is a very effective method of reducing the laser's linewidth and improving its tunability. We have developed an extremely simple laser of this type, built from inexpensive commercial components with only a few minor modifications. A 780~nm laser built to this design has an output power of 80~mW, a linewidth of 350~kHz, and it has been continuously locked to a Doppler-free rubidium transition for several days.},

  abstract = {Feature models are a widely used modeling notation for variability and commonality management in software product line (SPL) engineering. In order to keep an SPL and its feature model aligned, feature models must be changed by including/excluding new features and products, either because faults in the model are found or to reflect the normal evolution of the SPL. The modification of the feature model to be made to satisfy these change requirements can be complex and error-prone. In this paper, we present a method that is able to automatically update a feature model in order to satisfy a given update request. The method is based on an evolutionary algorithm that iteratively applies structure-preserving mutations to the original model, until the model is completely updated or some other termination condition occurs. Among all the possible models achieving the update request, the method privileges those structurally simpler. We evaluate the approach on real-world feature models; although it does not guarantee to completely update all the possible feature models, empirical analysis shows that, on average, around 89% of requested changes are applied.},

The tool allows importing/exporting models of combinatorial problems from/to different application domains, by means of a common interchange syntax notation and a corresponding interoperable semantic meta-model. Moreover, the tool is a framework allowing embedding and transparent invocation of multiple, different implementations of combinatorial algorithms. \citlab{} has been designed tightly integrated with the Eclipse IDE framework, by means of its plug-in extension mechanism. It is intended to easy the spread of CIT testing both in industrial practice and in academic research, by allowing users and researchers to apply multiple test suite generation algorithms, each with its peculiarities, on the same problem models, and let them compare the results in order to select the one that best fits their needs, while alleviating from the pain of knowing all the different details and notations of the underlying CIT tools.},

Test generation from feature models, i.e. generating a valid and representative subset of all the possible product configurations, is still an open challenge. A common approach is to build combinatorial interaction test suites, for instance achieving pairwise coverage among the features. In this paper we show how standard feature models can be translated to combinatorial interaction models in our framework \citlab{}, with all the advantages of having a combinatorial testing environment (in terms of a clear semantics, editing facilities, language for seeds and test goals, and generation algorithms). We present our translation which gives a precise semantics to feature models and it tries to minimize the number of parameter and constraints while preserving the original semantics of the feature model. Experiments show the advantages of our approach.},

Combinatorial testing generator tools are strongly decoupled making difficult their interoperability and the exchange of models and data. In this paper, we propose an abstract and concrete specific language for combinatorial problems. It features and formally defines the concepts of parameters and types, constraints, seeds, and test goals. The language is defined by means of XTEXT, a framework for the definition of domain-specific languages. XTEXT is used to derive a powerful editor integrated with eclipse and with all the expected features of a modern editor. Eclipse is also used to build an extensible framework in which test generators, importers, and exporters can be easily added as plugins.},

	Testing and fault localization are very expensive software engineering tasks that have been tried to be automated. Although many successful techniques have been designed, the actual change of the code for fixing the discovered faults is still a human-only task. Even in the ideal case in which automated tools could tell us exactly where the location of a fault is, it is not always trivial how to fix the code. In this paper we analyse the possibility of automating the complex task of fixing faults. We propose to model this task as a search problem, and hence to use for example evolutionary algorithms to solve it. We then discuss the potential of this approach and how its current limitations can be addressed in the future. This task is extremely challenging and mainly unexplored in the literature. Hence, this paper only covers an initial investigation and gives directions for future work. A research prototype called JAFF and a case study are presented to give first validation of this approach.},

  abstract  = {Combinatorial testing is as an effective testing technique to reveal failures in a given system, based on input combinations coverage and combinatorial optimization. Combinatorial testing of strength t (t???2) requires that each t-wise tuple of values of the different system input parameters is covered by at least one test case. Combinatorial test suite generation algorithms aim at producing a test suite covering all the required tuples in a small (possibly minimal) number of test cases, in order to reduce the cost of testing. The most used combinatorial technique is the pairwise testing (t?=?2) which requires coverage of all pairs of input values. Constrained combinatorial testing takes also into account constraints over the system parameters, for instance forbidden tuples of inputs, modeling invalid or not realizable input values combinations. In this paper a new approach to combinatorial testing, tightly integrated with formal logic, is presented. In this approach, test predicates are used to formalize combinatorial testing as a logical problem, and an external formal logic tool is applied to solve it. Constraints over the input domain are expressed as logical predicates too, and effectively handled by the same tool. Moreover, inclusion or exclusion of select tuples is supported, allowing the user to customize the test suite layout. The proposed approach is supported by a prototype tool implementation and results of experimental assessment are also presented.},

Exploiting the counter example generation feature of Spin, we present a method to automatically generate from ASM specifications test sequences which accomplish a desired coverage. ASMs are used as test oracles to predict the expected outputs of units under test. A prototype tool that implements the proposed method is presented. Experimental results in evaluating the method are reported. The experiments include test sequence generation, tests execution, code coverage measurement for a case study implemented in Java, and comparison with random tests generation. Benefits and limitations in using model checking are discussed.},

We define for ASM specifications a set of adequacy criteria measuring the coverage achieved by a test suite, and determining whether sufficient testing has been performed. We introduce a method to automatically generate from ASM specifications test sequences which accomplish a desired coverage. This method exploits the counter example generation of the model checker SMV. We use ASMs as test oracles to predict the expected outputs of units under test.},

  abstract     = {In Combinatorial Interaction Testing, models specify a set of parameters with associated domains, and some constraints over the parameters. Test generation tools produce, starting from these models, test suites for achieving some given coverage criteria. The validation of both the models and the produced test suites is a worthwhile activity. Validating the models permits to early discover possible defects in them, to feed the test generations tools with good inputs and, possibly, to improve the quality of the testing process. Validating the produced test suites, instead, permits to check if the test generation tools are correct and to judge their quality. This paper proposes to validate the models by checking that the constraints are consistent, that there is no constraint implied by the other constraints, and that the parameters and their values are really necessary. The proposed test suite validation, instead, consists in checking that the tests respect the type definitions and the constraints, that all the test requirements are covered, and that no unnecessary test is present in the test suite.},
