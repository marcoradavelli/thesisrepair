@article{Hawthorn_2001,
	Abstract = {We have developed an enhanced Littrow configuration extended cavity diode laser (ECDL) that can be tuned without changing the direction of the output beam. The output of a conventional Littrow ECDL is reflected from a plane mirror fixed parallel to the tuning diffraction grating. Using a free-space Michelson wavemeter to measure the laser wavelength, we can tune the laser over a range greater than 10 nm without any alteration of alignment.},

@article{Reference3,
	Abstract = {Operating a laser diode in an extended cavity which provides frequency-selective feedback is a very effective method of reducing the laser's linewidth and improving its tunability. We have developed an extremely simple laser of this type, built from inexpensive commercial components with only a few minor modifications. A 780~nm laser built to this design has an output power of 80~mW, a linewidth of 350~kHz, and it has been continuously locked to a Doppler-free rubidium transition for several days.},

The tool allows importing/exporting models of combinatorial problems from/to different application domains, by means of a common interchange syntax notation and a corresponding interoperable semantic meta-model. Moreover, the tool is a framework allowing embedding and transparent invocation of multiple, different implementations of combinatorial algorithms. \citlab{} has been designed tightly integrated with the Eclipse IDE framework, by means of its plug-in extension mechanism. It is intended to easy the spread of CIT testing both in industrial practice and in academic research, by allowing users and researchers to apply multiple test suite generation algorithms, each with its peculiarities, on the same problem models, and let them compare the results in order to select the one that best fits their needs, while alleviating from the pain of knowing all the different details and notations of the underlying CIT tools.},

	Abstract = {Feature models are commonly used to represent product lines and systems with a set of features interrelated each others. Test generation from feature models, i.e. generating a valid and representative subset of all the possible product configurations, is still an open challenge. A common approach is to build combinatorial interaction test suites, for instance achieving pairwise coverage among the features. In this paper we show how standard feature models can be translated to combinatorial interaction models in our framework \citlab{}, with all the advantages of having a combinatorial testing environment (in terms of a clear semantics, editing facilities, language for seeds and test goals, and generation algorithms). We present our translation which gives a precise semantics to feature models and it tries to minimize the number of parameter and constraints while preserving the original semantics of the feature model. Experiments show the advantages of our approach.},

	Abstract = {Although the research community around combinatorial interaction testing has been very active for several years, it has failed to find common solutions on some issues. First of all, there is not a common abstract nor concrete language to express combinatorial problems. Combinatorial testing generator tools are strongly decoupled making difficult their interoperability and the exchange of models and data. In this paper, we propose an abstract and concrete specific language for combinatorial problems. It features and formally defines the concepts of parameters and types, constraints, seeds, and test goals. The language is defined by means of XTEXT, a framework for the definition of domain-specific languages. XTEXT is used to derive a powerful editor integrated with eclipse and with all the expected features of a modern editor. Eclipse is also used to build an extensible framework in which test generators, importers, and exporters can be easily added as plugins.},

	Abstract = {Abstract
	Testing and fault localization are very expensive software engineering tasks that have been tried to be automated. Although many successful techniques have been designed, the actual change of the code for fixing the discovered faults is still a human-only task. Even in the ideal case in which automated tools could tell us exactly where the location of a fault is, it is not always trivial how to fix the code. In this paper we analyse the possibility of automating the complex task of fixing faults. We propose to model this task as a search problem, and hence to use for example evolutionary algorithms to solve it. We then discuss the potential of this approach and how its current limitations can be addressed in the future. This task is extremely challenging and mainly unexplored in the literature. Hence, this paper only covers an initial investigation and gives directions for future work. A research prototype called JAFF and a case study are presented to give first validation of this approach.},

@article{jar10,
	Abstract = {Combinatorial testing is as an effective testing technique to reveal failures in a given system, based on input combinations coverage and combinatorial optimization. Combinatorial testing of strength t (t???2) requires that each t-wise tuple of values of the different system input parameters is covered by at least one test case. Combinatorial test suite generation algorithms aim at producing a test suite covering all the required tuples in a small (possibly minimal) number of test cases, in order to reduce the cost of testing. The most used combinatorial technique is the pairwise testing (t?=?2) which requires coverage of all pairs of input values. Constrained combinatorial testing takes also into account constraints over the system parameters, for instance forbidden tuples of inputs, modeling invalid or not realizable input values combinations. In this paper a new approach to combinatorial testing, tightly integrated with formal logic, is presented. In this approach, test predicates are used to formalize combinatorial testing as a logical problem, and an external formal logic tool is applied to solve it. Constraints over the input domain are expressed as logical predicates too, and effectively handled by the same tool. Moreover, inclusion or exclusion of select tuples is supported, allowing the user to customize the test suite layout. The proposed approach is supported by a prototype tool implementation and results of experimental assessment are also presented.},

Exploiting the counter example generation feature of Spin, we present a method to automatically generate from ASM specifications test sequences which accomplish a desired coverage. ASMs are used as test oracles to predict the expected outputs of units under test. A prototype tool that implements the proposed method is presented. Experimental results in evaluating the method are reported. The experiments include test sequence generation, tests execution, code coverage measurement for a case study implemented in Java, and comparison with random tests generation. Benefits and limitations in using model checking are discussed.},

We define for ASM specifications a set of adequacy criteria measuring the coverage achieved by a test suite, and determining whether sufficient testing has been performed. We introduce a method to automatically generate from ASM specifications test sequences which accomplish a desired coverage. This method exploits the counter example generation of the model checker SMV. We use ASMs as test oracles to predict the expected outputs of units under test.},

	Abstract = {In Combinatorial Interaction Testing, models specify a set of parameters with associated domains, and some constraints over the parameters. Test generation tools produce, starting from these models, test suites for achieving some given coverage criteria. The validation of both the models and the produced test suites is a worthwhile activity. Validating the models permits to early discover possible defects in them, to feed the test generations tools with good inputs and, possibly, to improve the quality of the testing process. Validating the produced test suites, instead, permits to check if the test generation tools are correct and to judge their quality. This paper proposes to validate the models by checking that the constraints are consistent, that there is no constraint implied by the other constraints, and that the parameters and their values are really necessary. The proposed test suite validation, instead, consists in checking that the tests respect the type definitions and the constraints, that all the test requirements are covered, and that no unnecessary test is present in the test suite.},

ASMs are used as test oracles to predict the expected outputs of units under test. A prototype tool that implements the proposed method is presented. Experimental results in evaluating the method are reported. The experiments include test sequence generation, tests execution, code coverage measurement for a case study implemented in Java, and comparison with random tests generation. Benefits and limitations in using model checking are discussed.},

First of all, there is not a common abstract nor concrete language to express combinatorial problems. Combinatorial testing generator tools are strongly decoupled making difficult their interoperability and the exchange of models and data. In this paper, we propose an abstract and concrete specific language for combinatorial problems. It features and formally defines the concepts of parameters and types, constraints, seeds, and test goals. The language is defined by means of XTEXT, a framework for the definition of domain-specific languages. XTEXT is used to derive a powerful editor integrated with eclipse and with all the expected features of a modern editor. Eclipse is also used to build an extensible framework in which test generators, importers, and exporters can be easily added as plugins.},

Moreover, the tool is a framework allowing embedding and transparent invocation of multiple, different implementations of combinatorial algorithms. \citlab{} has been designed tightly integrated with the Eclipse IDE framework, by means of its plug-in extension mechanism. It is intended to easy the spread of CIT testing both in industrial practice and in academic research, by allowing users and researchers to apply multiple test suite generation algorithms, each with its peculiarities, on the same problem models, and let them compare the results in order to select the one that best fits their needs, while alleviating from the pain of knowing all the different details and notations of the underlying CIT tools.},

	Abstract                 = {Recently, many formal methods, such as the SCR (Software Cost Reduction) requirements method, have been proposed for improving the quality of software specifications. Although improved specifications are valuable, the ultimate objective of software development is to produce software that satisfies its requirements. To evaluate the correctness of a software implementation, one can apply black-box testing to determine whether the implementation, given a sequence of system inputs, produces the correct system outputs. This paper describes a specification-based method for constructing a suite of "test sequences", where a test sequence is a sequence of inputs and outputs for testing a software implementation. The test sequences are derived from a tabular SCR requirements specification containing diverse data types, i.e., integer, boolean, and enumerated types. From the functions defined in the SCR specification, the method forms a collection of predicates called "branches", which cover all possible software behaviors described by the specification. Based on these predicates, the method then derives a suite of test sequences by using a model checker's ability to construct counterexamples. The paper presents the results of applying our method to four specifications, including a sizable component of a contractor specification of a real system},

	Abstract                 = {Combinatorial interaction testing (CIT) is an emerging testing technique that has proved to be effective in finding faults due to the interaction among inputs. Efficient test generation for CIT is still an open problem especially when applied to real models having meaningful size and containing many constraints among inputs. In this paper we present a novel technique for the automatic generation of compact test suites starting from models containing constraints given in general form. It is based on the use of Multivalued Decision Diagrams (MDDs) which prove to be suitable to efficiently support CIT. We devise and experiment several optimizations including a novel variation of the classical greedy policy normally used in similar algorithms. The results of a thorough comparison with other similar techniques are presented and show that our approach can provide several advantages in terms of applicability, test suite size, generation time, and cost.},

	Abstract                 = {Combinatorial testing is as an effective testing technique to reveal failures in a given system, based on input combinations coverage and combinatorial optimization. Combinatorial testing of strength t (t???2) requires that each t-wise tuple of values of the different system input parameters is covered by at least one test case. Combinatorial test suite generation algorithms aim at producing a test suite covering all the required tuples in a small (possibly minimal) number of test cases, in order to reduce the cost of testing. The most used combinatorial technique is the pairwise testing (t?=?2) which requires coverage of all pairs of input values. Constrained combinatorial testing takes also into account constraints over the system parameters, for instance forbidden tuples of inputs, modeling invalid or not realizable input values combinations. In this paper a new approach to combinatorial testing, tightly integrated with formal logic, is presented. In this approach, test predicates are used to formalize combinatorial testing as a logical problem, and an external formal logic tool is applied to solve it. Constraints over the input domain are expressed as logical predicates too, and effectively handled by the same tool. Moreover, inclusion or exclusion of select tuples is supported, allowing the user to customize the test suite layout. The proposed approach is supported by a prototype tool implementation and results of experimental assessment are also presented.},

Test generation from feature models, i.e. generating a valid and representative subset of all the possible product configurations, is still an open challenge. A common approach is to build combinatorial interaction test suites, for instance achieving pairwise coverage among the features. In this paper we show how standard feature models can be translated to combinatorial interaction models in our framework \citlab{}, with all the advantages of having a combinatorial testing environment (in terms of a clear semantics, editing facilities, language for seeds and test goals, and generation algorithms). We present our translation which gives a precise semantics to feature models and it tries to minimize the number of parameter and constraints while preserving the original semantics of the feature model. Experiments show the advantages of our approach.},

Exploiting the counter example generation feature of Spin, we present a method to automatically generate from ASM specifications test sequences which accomplish a desired coverage. ASMs are used as test oracles to predict the expected outputs of units under test. A prototype tool that implements the proposed method is presented. Experimental results in evaluating the method are reported. The experiments include test sequence generation, tests execution, code coverage measurement for a case study implemented in Java, and comparison with random tests generation. Benefits and limitations in using model checking are discussed.},

First of all, there is not a common abstract nor concrete language to express combinatorial problems. Combinatorial testing generator tools are strongly decoupled making difficult their interoperability and the exchange of models and data. In this paper, we propose an abstract and concrete specific language for combinatorial problems. It features and formally defines the concepts of parameters and types, constraints, seeds, and test goals. The language is defined by means of XTEXT, a framework for the definition of domain-specific languages. XTEXT is used to derive a powerful editor integrated with eclipse and with all the expected features of a modern editor. Eclipse is also used to build an extensible framework in which test generators, importers, and exporters can be easily added as plugins.},

It is intended to easy the spread of CIT testing both in industrial practice and in academic research, by allowing users and researchers to apply multiple test suite generation algorithms, each with its peculiarities, on the same problem models, and let them compare the results in order to select the one that best fits their needs, while alleviating from the pain of knowing all the different details and notations of the underlying CIT tools.},

	Abstract                 = {Recently, many formal methods, such as the SCR (Software Cost Reduction) requirements method, have been proposed for improving the quality of software specifications. Although improved specifications are valuable, the ultimate objective of software development is to produce software that satisfies its requirements. To evaluate the correctness of a software implementation, one can apply black-box testing to determine whether the implementation, given a sequence of system inputs, produces the correct system outputs. This paper describes a specification-based method for constructing a suite of "test sequences", where a test sequence is a sequence of inputs and outputs for testing a software implementation. The test sequences are derived from a tabular SCR requirements specification containing diverse data types, i.e., integer, boolean, and enumerated types. From the functions defined in the SCR specification, the method forms a collection of predicates called "branches", which cover all possible software behaviors described by the specification. Based on these predicates, the method then derives a suite of test sequences by using a model checker's ability to construct counterexamples. The paper presents the results of applying our method to four specifications, including a sizable component of a contractor specification of a real system},

Efficient test generation for CIT is still an open problem especially when applied to real models having meaningful size and containing many constraints among inputs. In this paper we present a novel technique for the automatic generation of compact test suites starting from models containing constraints given in general form. It is based on the use of Multivalued Decision Diagrams (MDDs) which prove to be suitable to efficiently support CIT. We devise and experiment several optimizations including a novel variation of the classical greedy policy normally used in similar algorithms. The results of a thorough comparison with other similar techniques are presented and show that our approach can provide several advantages in terms of applicability, test suite size, generation time, and cost.},

Test generation from feature models, i.e. generating a valid and representative subset of all the possible product configurations, is still an open challenge. A common approach is to build combinatorial interaction test suites, for instance achieving pairwise coverage among the features. In this paper we show how standard feature models can be translated to combinatorial interaction models in our framework \citlab{}, with all the advantages of having a combinatorial testing environment (in terms of a clear semantics, editing facilities, language for seeds and test goals, and generation algorithms). We present our translation which gives a precise semantics to feature models and it tries to minimize the number of parameter and constraints while preserving the original semantics of the feature model. Experiments show the advantages of our approach.},

	Abstract                 = {Combinatorial testing is as an effective testing technique to reveal failures in a given system, based on input combinations coverage and combinatorial optimization. Combinatorial testing of strength t (t???2) requires that each t-wise tuple of values of the different system input parameters is covered by at least one test case. Combinatorial test suite generation algorithms aim at producing a test suite covering all the required tuples in a small (possibly minimal) number of test cases, in order to reduce the cost of testing. The most used combinatorial technique is the pairwise testing (t?=?2) which requires coverage of all pairs of input values. Constrained combinatorial testing takes also into account constraints over the system parameters, for instance forbidden tuples of inputs, modeling invalid or not realizable input values combinations. In this paper a new approach to combinatorial testing, tightly integrated with formal logic, is presented. In this approach, test predicates are used to formalize combinatorial testing as a logical problem, and an external formal logic tool is applied to solve it. Constraints over the input domain are expressed as logical predicates too, and effectively handled by the same tool. Moreover, inclusion or exclusion of select tuples is supported, allowing the user to customize the test suite layout. The proposed approach is supported by a prototype tool implementation and results of experimental assessment are also presented.},

	abstract = {The full behavior of software-intensive systems of systems (SoS) emerges during operation only. Runtime monitoring approaches have thus been proposed to detect deviations from the expected behavior. They commonly rely on temporal logic or domain-speciﬁc languages to formally deﬁne requirements, which are then checked by analyzing the stream of monitored events and event data. Some approaches also allow developers to generate constraints from declarative speciﬁcations of the expected behavior. However, independent of the approach, deep domain knowledge is required to specify the desired behavior. This knowledge is often not accessible in SoS environments with multiple development teams independently working on different, heterogeneous systems. In this New Ideas Paper we thus describe an approach that automatically mines constraints for runtime monitoring from event logs recorded in SoS. Our approach builds on ideas from speciﬁcation mining, process mining, and machine learning to mine different types of constraints on event occurrence, event timing, and event data. The approach further presents the mined constraints to users in an existing constraint language and it ranks the constraints using different criteria. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach by applying it to event logs from a real-world industrial SoS.},

	abstract = {Models in Model-Driven Engineering are heavily edited in all stages of software development and can become temporarily inconsistent. In general, there are many alternatives to fix an inconsistency, the actual choice is left to the discretion of the developer. Model repair tools should support developers by proposing a short list of repair alternatives. Such recommendations will be only accepted in practice if the generated proposals are plausible and understandable. Current approaches, which mostly focus on fully automatic, non-interactive model repairs, fail in meeting these requirements. This paper proposes a new approach to generate repair proposals for inconsistencies that were introduced by incomplete editing processes which can be located in the version history of a model. Such an incomplete editing process is extended to a full execution of a consistency-preserving edit operation. We demonstrate our repair tool ReVision using a simplified multi-view UML model of a video on demand system, a screencast is provided at http:// pi.informatik.uni-siegen.de/ projects/ SiLift/ icse2018/ .},

	abstract = {Resolving inconsistencies in software models is a complex task because the number of repairs grows exponentially. Existing approaches thus emphasize on selected repairs only but doing so diminishes their usefulness. This paper copes with the large number of repairs by focusing on what caused an inconsistency and presenting repairs as a linearly growing repair tree. The cause is computed by examining the runtime evaluation of the inconsistency to understand where and why it failed. The individual changes that make up repairs are then modeled in a repair tree as alternatives and sequences reﬂecting the syntactic structure of the inconsistent design rule. The approach is automated and tool supported. Its scalability was empirically evaluated on 29 UML models and 18 OCL design rules where we show that the approach computes repair trees in milliseconds on average. We believe that the approach is applicable to arbitrary modeling and constraint languages.},

Unfortunately, human resources are often insufﬁcient to ﬁx all reported and known bugs. To address this issue, several automated patch generation techniques have been proposed. In particular, a genetic-programming-based patch generation technique, GenProg, proposed by Weimer et al., has shown promising results. However, these techniques can generate nonsensical patches due to the randomness of their mutation operations.},
